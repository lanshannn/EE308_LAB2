  This is individual programing work.
- Indentation
    The indentation between higher level and lower level nesting is 4 spaces.
- Variable naming
    I usually use English letters(a,b,c...) to name variable.
- Maximum number of characters per line
    The maximum number of characters per line will be 50 approximately because I'll try to keep it within the screen.
- Maximum number of function lines
    The maximum nember of function lines will be 20 to make it clear and not so complex.
- Function and class naming
    Function and class naming will generally includes the main purpose of this function or class. In addition, I will 
capitalize the first letter of each word and add underscore between words.
    For example, I will name a function for counting sheep as "Count_Sheep".
- constant
- Blank line rule
    As usual, I will set one blank line between each function or class.
- Annotation rules
    I will use "//" to make annotation.
- Space before and after operator
- Other rules
